# Time Series Forecasting Multivariate Forecasting

Time series forecasting is the process of analyzing time series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions and inform strategic decision-making. A Multivariate time series has more than one time-dependent variable. Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has some dependency on other variables.
